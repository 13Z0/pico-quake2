Copied from pico-duke3D (commit a7d84b5) 3rdparty/pico_shared_drivers, itself a vendored subset of
pico_shared (https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico_shared). Local changes are marked pico-quake2:.

nespad/ (nespad.h, nespad.cpp, nespad.pio) was re-copied from pico_shared itself at commit a7cc387;
its one local change is nespad_read_ready().

pico_hdmi/: video_output.c, hstx_data_island_queue.c and hstx_data_island_queue.h were re-copied
on 2026-11-11 from pico_shared 722f019, unchanged. This brings real DVI 1.0 output in DVI mode
(3e19ce0, PICO_HDMI_DVI_USE_DATA_ISLANDS 0), the HSTX block reset on start and resync (a252e47)
and the split back porch of DVI lines (722f019). CMakeLists.txt keeps its local queue size and
NOHSTXCLOCK and now links hardware_resets explicitly. hstx.c is not built.
